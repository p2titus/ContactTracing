an implementation of a rabbitmq server
used to keep a distributed queue of positive cases to be contact traced
also keeps contacts to be traced

the queue will be as resilient to failure as possible
in the event of a failure, there should be some recovery protocol

this collection of code does not necessarily have to be run on the same server
as the website, but it must be run and configured correctly to allow django to
function as required
