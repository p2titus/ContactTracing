To run the Selenium-based tests of the testingCentre app you need to first:

1. Install Selenium using the command "python -m pip install selenium" on macOS/Linux or "py -m pip install selenium" on Windows.

2. Install Google Chrome.

3. Download ChromeDriver from "https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads", name the downloaded file "chromedriver" (without extension) and put it in the tests folder.

Note: the version of ChromeDriver downloaded must correspond to the operating system of your device and the version of Google Chrome installed.
